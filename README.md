# Lovely File Manager
A simple file manager, inspired by Joshuto.

Currently a work in progress and very buggy. Will crash very easily, like if you go too far up or down a directory, or enter a file. The only thing this program can do is browse through your files and directories.

## How to run
Download the binary from the release pages and run
```
chmod +x lfm
./lfm
```

## How to use
 * h - go up a directory
 * l - enter a directory
 * j - go down a line
 * k - go up a line

## Future goals
  * Entering a file will open it in a text editor
  * UI Redesign
